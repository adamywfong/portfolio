# Portfolio

## Description

This project was created to a portfolio for viewing by potential employers that displays info about me, samples of past deployed work, and my contact information. In addition to ultimately being a way to publically display myself for employent, design of this project was an opportunity to practice webpage formatting with CSS and HTML.  Clicking on a project title will direct users to deployed application.
